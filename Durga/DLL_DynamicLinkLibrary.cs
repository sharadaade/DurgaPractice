// Creaing a .net component or assemblies or User Defined Class Libraries or DLL(Dynamic Link Library)

//what is .net component:
//----------------------
//1.A component is reusable piece of code and it is in the form of DLL.
//2.Once component is designed , it can be reused from any kind of application
//  like in console application, windows forms application etc.
//3.Once a component is designed in any prg language of .net that can be reused from
//  any other prg languages of .net.
//4. .net component will provide language interoperability.
//5. To create .net component we use class library template.
//6. End user or client will never interact with DLL directly.
//7. Always end user will interact with some application and the application will interact with component or DLL.
//8. The main advantage to create .net compnent or dll is security and reusability.

//User------> Application -------> Component or DLL
